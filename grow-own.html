                <h3>Yukon Gold Potatoes</h3>
                <img src="media\images\yukon gold.jpg" alt="Yukon Gold Potato" width="250" height="100">
                <p>
                    The Yukon Gold potato is one of the most
                    popular potato varieties because it falls
                    into the all-purpose category.
                    Yukon Golds have
                    thin gold skin that doesn't need to be
                    peeled before mashing,
                    and their creamy flesh has a sweet, buttery flavor.
                    Use just about any cooking method for these gold
                    potatoes and you won't be disappointed with the results.
                    Because they're so versatile, Yukons are a
                    popular option for restaurants and commercial kitchens.

                <h3>Russet Potato</h3>
                <img src="media\images\russet.png" alt="Russet Potato" width="250" height="100">
                <p>
                    Russet potatoes are highly recognizable for their ruddy,
                    dark brown skin and large size. Reach for
                    this potato when you want to make baked potatoes.
                    The thick skin of a Russet crisps up while baking
                    and the interior becomes light and fluffy,
                    perfect for holding toppings like butter, cheese, or sour
                    cream. Russets are also great for mashing,
                    as long as the skins are peeled first. This starchy
                    potato is ideal for cutting into french fries because the large
                    size produces a high yield and the
                    potato texture crisps up when deep fried.

                <h3>All Blue Potato</h3>
                <img src="media\images\allblue.jpg" alt="All Blue Potato" width="250" height="100">
                <p>Blue potatoes like the All Blue variety have dark purple skin 
                    and purple flesh that comes from a high
                    concentration of the antioxidant, anthocyanin. This healthy 
                    flavonoid is also present in other dark
                    purple produce, like blueberries, red onion, or eggplant. 
                    All Blue potatoes are classified as
                    all-purpose, which makes them useful for a variety of cooking methods. 
                    They do have a higher starch
                    content than other blue potatoes, so reach for this potato to make a vibrant blue mash.
                    All Blues can be easily identified from other blue varieties by a pale ring in their purple flesh.
