            <h2>
                Are potatoes vegetables?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yes. Potatoes are stem tubers and are considered a starchy vegetable.
                As the name implies, these
                vegetables contain more starch as compared to others. This isn‚Äôt bad.
                It means that the vegetable
                delivers more calories and typically less fiber.

                Starch is a type of carbohydrate that our body breaks into glucose to use as energy.
                Therefore, starchy
                foods could be a good food source if you want to add calories or add a food choice to round out a meal.

                Many cultures serve sides of rice, pasta, or potatoes with meals. These choices add calories and give a
                ‚Äúfull feeling‚Äù to hungry families. Other types of starchy vegetables include:

                <li>
                    green peas
                </li>
                <li>
                    winter squash, such as butternut or acorn
                </li>
                <li>
                    sweet potatoes and yams
                </li>
                <li>
                    beans and lentils
                </li>

            <h2>Potatoes for health and nutrition</h2>
            <p>
                In addition to starch, potatoes contain vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They‚Äôre rich in vitamin C, which
                is an antioxidant. Potatoes were a life-saving food source in early times because the vitamin C
                prevented scurvy. Another major nutrient in potatoes is potassium, an electrolyte which aids in the
                workings of our heart, muscles, and nervous system. Potato skin contains fiber, which is important for
                digestive health.

                Different types of potatoes, especially those that come in other colors, contain more nutrients that
                have health benefits. In general, the darker the potato, the more antioxidants it contains. Sweet
                potatoes are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple
                potatoes are rich in antioxidants including anthocyanins which may prevent heart disease and cancer and
                boost brain health. üôåüôå
